gas-cc,247,https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/fossil_energy_technologies gives 727 for a 2x1 F-frame CC and cites https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1961845/. Page 13 of the NETL reference indicates that comes from 2x 238.5 GTs + 1x 263 ST - auxiliary power. We average the constituent turbine capacities to get 247 MW.
gas-cc_h_1x1,330,https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/fossil_energy_technologies mentions 649MWe for a 1x1 H-frame CC and cites https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2376908. Page 6 indicates this comes from 1 CT + 1 ST - auxiliary power. We average the gross power capacity to get 330 MW.
gas-cc_h_2x1,336,https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/fossil_energy_technologies mentions 992MWe for a 2x1 H-frame CC and cites https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1961845/. Page 17 of the NETL reference indicates that this comes from 2x343 GTs + 1x324 ST - auxiliary power. We average the constituent turbine capacities to get 336MW
